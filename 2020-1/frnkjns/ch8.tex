Problem 19. \\

Let $E_{n, m} = \left\{ |f| \leq n \right\} \cap B\left( 0, m \right) $. Then graph of $|f| 1_{E_{n, m}}$ is measure zero set. Also note that graph of $f$ $\subset$ graph of $|f|$ $\cup$ graph of  $-|f|$. But we have graph of $|f|$ is subset of $\bigcup_{n, m} \text{graph of } |f|1_{E_{n, m}}$ which is null set. So result follows.
