	First assume that $X_n \rightarrow X$ in probability.
	Let $f$ be any continuous, bounded function.
	Then, by bounded convergence theorem, $f(X_n) \rightarrow f(X)$ in $L_1$.
	Thus $X_n \rightarrow X$ in distribution.

	Now assume that $X_n \rightarrow c$ in distribution.
	Let $F$ be distribution function of $c$.
	Since $c$ is constant, $F(c + \varepsilon) = 1$, $F(c) = 1$, and $F(c-\varepsilon) = 0$ for any $\varepsilon>0$.
	Note that the discountinuity point of $F$ is only $c$.
	Then 
	\[
		P(|X_n - c| \leq \varepsilon) \geq P(X_n \leq c+\varepsilon) - P(X_n \leq c -\varepsilon) \rightarrow 1
	\]
	Therefore, $X_n \rightarrow c$ in probability.

	First note that the portmanteau theorem holds not only for bounded continuous function but also for bounded uniformly continuous function.
	Because, when we look the proof, the trapezoid function which we used is bounded, uniformly continuous(actually, Lipschitz). 

	Now without loss of generality, assume that $c = 0$.
	Let $f$ be bounded, uniformly continuous function.
	Let $w_\delta (f) = \sup_{|x-y| \leq \delta} |f(x) - f(y)|$.
	Then $w_\delta (f) \rightarrow 0$ as $\delta \rightarrow 0$ because of uniform continuity.
	Now, consider the following:
	\[
		\begin{split}
			& \left | Ef(X_n + Y_n) - Ef(X) \right | \\
			& \leq \left | Ef(X_n + Y_n) - Ef(X_n) \right | + \left | Ef(X_n) - Ef(X) \right | \\
			& \leq w_\delta (f) + 2\sup |f| P(|Y_n| > \delta) + o(1) \\
		\end{split}
	\]
	By taking $\limsup_{n\rightarrow 0}$, the last term $\leq w_\delta (f)$.
	Therefore, by $\delta \rightarrow 0$, we get the result.

	\qed
