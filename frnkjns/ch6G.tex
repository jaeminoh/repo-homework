Problem 43. \\

Define $\varphi\left( E \right) = \int_E f d\mu$. Then $\varphi(\emptyset) = 0$ and $\varphi$ is countably additive. Let $P_n = \left\{ x\in X : f(x) \geq {1\over n} \right\}$. Then $P_n$ is measurable hence $\varphi\left( P_n \right) = 0$ for all $n$. $\varphi\left( P_n \right) = \int_{P_n} f d\mu \geq {1\over n} \int_{P_n} f d\mu = {1\over n} \mu\left( P_n \right)$. Hence $\mu\left( P_n \right) = 0$ for all $n$.
Therefore $\mu\left( \left\{ x\in X : f(x) > 0 \right\} \right) = \mu\left( \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}P_n \right) = 0$.

Similarly, we can deduce that $\mu\left( \left\{ x\in X : f(x) < 0 \right\} \right) = 0$. Therefore $f = 0$ a.e. \\

Problem 44. \\

Define $\varphi\left( E \right) = \int_{E} f d\lambda$ for $E \in \mathcal{L}$. Such $\varphi$ has same property as in problem 43. Note that $\varphi\left( \left\{ x \right\} \right) = 0$ for each $x \in \mathbb{R}$ since one-point set is null set.

Every open set $G \subset \mathbb{R}$ can be expressed as nonoverlapping union of special rectangles. So $\varphi\left( G \right) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \varphi\left( \left[ a_k, b_k \right] \right)$ where $G = \cup_{k=1}^{\infty}\left[ a_k, b_k \right]$.

Also, $\mathbb{R}$ is open. Therefore $\varphi\left( F \right) = \varphi\left( \mathbb{R} - G \right)$ for all closed set $F\subset \mathbb{R}$. Then $\varphi\left( F_{\sigma} \right) = 0$. All Lebesgue measurable set $E$ can be expressed as $F_{\sigma} \cup N$ where $N$ is a null set.

Therefore $\varphi\left( E \right) = 0$ for all $E \in \mathcal{L}$. By previous problem, we get $f = 0$ $\lambda$-a.e. \\
