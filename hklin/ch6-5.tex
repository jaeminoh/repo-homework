\subsection*{5. Simultaneous Triangulization}\hfill \\

In 6-4, we studied about conditions for triangulability of only one linear operator on finite dimension vector space $V$.
But in this section, we are curious about conditions for triangulability of \emph{collection of linear operators} on $V$. That is, we want find ordered basis for $V$ which represents each linear operator in given collection as triangular matrix.

In fact, if commuting collection is given and each linear operator is triangulable, then we can find ordered basis for $V$ which triangulize every linear operator in given collection simultaneously.

Above sentence is still valid if we replace 'triangul-' to 'diagonal-'. \\
