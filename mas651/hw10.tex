\begin{problem}[8.1.1] \hfill

	By theorem 8.1.1, there is $T_{U, V}$ stopping time such that
	\[
		B(T_{U, V}) =_d X \text{ and } EX^2 = ET_{U, V}.
	\]

	By exercise 7.5.4,
	\[
		ET_{U, V}^2 \le 4 EB(T_{U, V})^4 = 4EX^4.
	\]

	\qed

\begin{problem}[8.1.2] \hfill

	Let $\psi(w) = \max\left\{ w(t): 0\le t \le 1 \right\} - \min\left\{ w(t): 0\le t\le 1 \right\}$.
	Then
	\[
		\frac{R_n}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + \psi\left( \frac{ S_{nt}}{\sqrt{n}} \right).
	\]
	Now $1/\sqrt{n} \rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$ in probability, and by theorem 8.1.5,
	the last term goes to
	\[
		\psi(B_t) = \max_{0\le t \le 1}B_t - \min_{0 \le t \le 1}B_t
	\]
	in distribution.

	By Slutsky's eqn, we can say that
	\[
		\frac{R_n}{\sqrt{n}} \rightarrow _d \max_{0\le t \le 1}B_t - \min_{0\le t\le 1}B_t.
	\]
	
	\qed
