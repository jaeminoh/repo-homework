\begin{problem}[10]
	\hfill

	Since each $f_n$ is bounded and $\mu\left( X \right) < \infty$, $f_n \in L^1$. We can conclude that $f$ is also bounded hence $f\in L^1$ because $f_n$ is uniformly convergent to $f$ and each $f_n$ is bounded.

	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
			\left | \int _X f_n d\mu - \int _X f d\mu \right | & \leq
			\int_X \left | f_n - f \right | d\mu \\
			& \leq \varepsilon \mu\left( X \right)
		\end{split}
		\label{<+label+>}
	\end{equation*}

	if $n$ is large, because of uniform convergence. So we can see that $\lim \int_X f_n d\mu = \int_X f d\mu$.
